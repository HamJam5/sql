SELECT firstName, lastName, city, state
FROM Person p
LEFT JOIN Address a ON p.personId=a.personId

/*
Use INNER JOIN when you want to return only records 
having pair on both sides, 
and use LEFT JOIN when you need all records from the “left” table, 
no matter if they have pair in the “right” table or not.
